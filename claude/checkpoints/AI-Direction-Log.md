### Entry 1 — 2026-04-27 — Project Setup & File Structure

**What I asked AI to do:**
Read all docs in `claude/docs/` and create the project file structure for DemonSlayerGame, mirroring what was done for CharacterSelectionScreen. Also create the AI Direction Log.

**What AI produced:**
- Folder structure: `src/components/panels/`, `src/components/screens/`, `src/assets/audio/`, `src/assets/images/`, `src/data/`, `src/hooks/`, `.github/workflows/`, `claude/checkpoints/`, `claude/design-intent/`
- `README.md` (attempted)
- `AI-Direction-Log.md`

**What I kept:**
- All directory structure
- `AI-Direction-Log.md`

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Rejected `README.md` — will be created at end of project only

**Why:**
README should reflect the finished project, not be a placeholder written at setup.

**Checkpoint:** NO

---

### Entry 2 — 2026-04-27 — GitHub Remote & First Push

**What I asked AI to do:**
Connect the GitHub repo and push the current files.

**What AI produced:**
- Confirmed remote `origin` was already pointing to `https://github.com/brunastefanii/DemonSlayerGame.git`
- Committed and pushed structure files
- `claude/.DS_Store` was accidentally included in the commit

**What I kept:**
- The push and commit

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Asked AI to add `.gitignore` to prevent `.DS_Store` from being tracked again
- AI removed the already-tracked `.DS_Store` files and pushed a cleanup commit

**Why:**
`.DS_Store` is a macOS system file, not project code. Should never be in a repo.

**Checkpoint:** NO

---

### Entry 3 — 2026-04-27 — Phase 1: Vite + React Scaffold

**What I asked AI to do:**
Initialize the Vite + React project and set up GitHub Pages auto-deploy.

**What AI produced:**
- `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `index.html`, `src/main.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`, `src/index.css`, `src/App.css`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Centralized state shape defined in `App.jsx`

**What I kept:**
- Everything

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Nothing rejected in this session

**Why:**
—

**Checkpoint:** NO

---

### Entry 4 — 2026-04-27 — Phase 2: Three-Panel System & All Screens

**What I asked AI to do:**
Build the three panels (BrowserPanel, HUDPanel, ControllerPanel), all six screens, UI components (DemonHead, FingerTrail), and wire centralized state.

**What AI produced:**
- `BrowserPanel.jsx` — renders active screen based on `gameScreen` state
- `HUDPanel.jsx` — score/timer/combo overlay, only visible during gameplay
- `ControllerPanel.jsx` — game timer with functional update to avoid stale closures
- All six screens: Splash, LevelSelect, CameraPermission, Countdown, Gameplay, TimesUp
- `DemonHead.jsx`, `FingerTrail.jsx`
- `gameData.json` with level configs and grade thresholds
- `screens.css` with placeholder styles

**What I kept:**
- Everything

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Nothing rejected in this session

**Why:**
—

**Checkpoint:** NO

---

### Entry 5 — 2026-04-27 — Phase 3: Demon Spawning & Movement

**What I asked AI to do:**
Add demon spawning from random screen edges and animate them moving toward the center. No slash detection — deferred to Phase 4.

**What AI produced:**
- Updated `ControllerPanel.jsx` with three `useEffect` hooks: timer, demon spawning, demon movement (~30fps)
- Updated `DemonHead.jsx` with pulse animation and red glow

**What I kept:**
- Everything

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Nothing rejected in this session

**Why:**
—

**Checkpoint:** NO

---

### Entry 6 — 2026-04-27 — Time Limit Adjustment

**What I asked AI to do:**
Change the time limit to 30 seconds for all levels (Easy was 60s, Medium was 45s).

**What AI produced:**
- Updated `gameData.json` — `timeLimit: 30` for Easy and Medium

**What I kept:**
- The change

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Nothing rejected

**Why:**
All modes should have the same 30-second time limit for consistency.

**Checkpoint:** NO

---

### Entry 7 — 2026-04-27 — Documentation Structure Correction

**What I asked AI to do:**
Clarify that the AI Direction Log is for chat history only. Records of Resistance should be a separate file inside `claude/checkpoints/`. Created `records-of-resistance.md` there.

**What AI produced:**
- Updated `AI-Direction-Log.md` (this file) — removed the embedded Records of Resistance table
- Created `claude/checkpoints/records-of-resistance.md`

**What I kept:**
- The new structure

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Removed Records of Resistance from this file — it was in the wrong place

**Why:**
Records of Resistance and chat history serve different purposes and should be separate documents.

**Checkpoint:** NO

---

---

### Entry 8 — 2026-04-27 — Phase 4: Camera & Hand Tracking

**What I asked AI to do:**
Add MediaPipe Hands integration so the camera tracks the user's fingertip in real time, and use that position to detect demon slays.

**What AI produced:**
- `useHandTracking.js` — MediaPipe Hands + Camera utility using callbackRef pattern
- Finger x-coordinate mirrored (`1 - tip.x`) to match `scaleX(-1)` video selfie view
- WASM loaded from CDN to avoid Vite bundling issues
- Slash detection in `ControllerPanel.jsx`: `SLAY_RADIUS = 50px`
- Demons marked `slayed: true` + `slayTime` on contact, removed after 650ms
- `FingerTrail.jsx` renders last 15 fingertip positions as fading dots

**What I kept:**
- Everything

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Deferred slash detection testing to Phase 4 (not Phase 3) — user's decision

**Why:**
Wanted demons moving on screen first before adding the slay layer.

**Checkpoint:** NO

---

### Entry 9 — 2026-04-27 — Phase 5a: Slay Animation

**What I asked AI to do:**
Add a visual animation when a demon is slayed. Chose the CSS clip-path split option from three options presented.

**What AI produced:**
- `DemonHead.css` split animation: left half clips `polygon(0 0, 50% 0, 50% 100%, 0 100%)` flying left + rotating, right half flying right + rotating
- `.demon-splatter` radial burst overlay
- Demon element stays in DOM for 650ms (SLAY_LINGER) during animation, then filtered out by movement loop

**What I kept:**
- The clip-path split approach

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Three options were presented (clip-path, particle burst, scale + fade) — chose clip-path

**Why:**
Most dramatic and on-brand for a slashing game.

**Checkpoint:** NO

---

### Entry 10 — 2026-04-27 — Phase 5b: Audio System

**What I asked AI to do:**
Add sound effects for all game events. Placeholder/programmatic sounds are fine; include WAV swap instructions. Do all sounds at once. Format: WAV.

**What AI produced:**
- `useAudio.js` — singleton Web Audio API module
- All sounds generated via oscillators and noise buffers — no files needed
- `playHover` (level card), `playCountdown` (3/2/1), `playGo` (GO!), `playSlay` (slash), `playCombo` (every 3 slays), `playHeartbeat` (≤10s), `playTick` (≤5s), `playTimesUp` (gong), `playMusic`/`stopMusic` (ambient drone)
- Each function includes a comment explaining how to swap for a real WAV file

**What I kept:**
- Everything

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Nothing rejected

**Why:**
—

**Checkpoint:** NO

---

### Entry 11 — 2026-04-27 — Hover Sound on Level Cards

**What I asked AI to do:**
Add the missing hover sound to LevelSelect — when the user hovers over Easy, Medium, or Hard cards.

**What AI produced:**
- Added `onMouseEnter={playHover}` to each level card button in `LevelSelect.jsx`
- `playHover` was already built in `useAudio.js` — just needed to be wired up

**What I kept:**
- The change

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Nothing rejected

**Why:**
The hover sound was defined but never connected to any element.

**Checkpoint:** NO

---

### Entry 12 — 2026-04-27 — Figma Design Review

**What I asked AI to do:**
Review the Figma inspiration image to understand what visual changes to make before implementing them.

**What AI produced:**
- Retrieved Figma node 101:4 (design inspiration screen)
- Identified key visual differences from current build:
  - Background: deep purple-black (`#0a0010`) vs current dark grey
  - Finger trail: neon magenta (`#e040fb`) with glow vs current yellow
  - Accent / demon UI: magenta/purple vs current red (`#e63946`)
  - HUD panel: dark glass panel with blur vs current flat overlay
  - Score popups: floating `+10 GOOD` / `+30 PERFECT` text on slay
  - Demon splatter: deep crimson + pink vs current red

**What I kept:**
- Analysis only — no changes made yet (checkpoint first)

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Deferred all visual changes until after checkpoint commit

**Why:**
User requested checkpoint before implementing any visual changes.

**Checkpoint:** YES — checkpoint-01.md

---

### Entry 13 — 2026-04-28 — Splash Screen Visual Implementation

**What I asked AI to do:**
Implement the splash screen using a custom background image (no button in the art) and recreate the PLAY button in CSS to match the design.

**What AI produced:**
- `SplashScreen.jsx` updated: imports background image, removes placeholder logo/silhouette, renders `.splash-bg` + CSS PLAY button
- `index.html`: Google Fonts link for Oswald 700
- `screens.css`: full splash section rewritten — contain background, CSS octagonal PLAY button with neon glow, diamond pips, hover/active states
- Button anchored with `position: absolute; bottom: 12%` after repositioning fix

**What I kept:**
- Everything after the responsiveness fix

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Initial `background-size: cover` caused bottom of image to be cropped — changed to `contain`
- Initial `padding-bottom: 10%` caused button to overlap SLAY text — changed to `position: absolute; bottom: 12%`

**Why:**
Image is 3:2; 16:9 desktop with cover crops the bottom. Button needed absolute anchoring to stay consistent across screen widths.

**Checkpoint:** YES — checkpoint-03.md

---

### Entry 15 — 2026-04-28 — Level Select Screen: Background + Cards Approved

**What I asked AI to do:**
1. Use a new background image (purple demon forest scene with "SELECT LEVEL / CHOOSE YOUR HUNT" baked in) for the level select screen.
2. Move the BACK button to upper left corner.
3. Implement the three Figma card designs (nodes 114:594 Easy, 114:618 Medium, 114:642 Hard).
4. Adjust card vertical position to sit just below "CHOOSE YOUR HUNT" text.
5. Adjust text content inside cards to sit lower, closer to the bottom border.

**What AI produced:**
- `demon slayer level select.png` saved to `src/assets/images/`
- `LevelSelect.jsx` updated: background image + LevelCard component + BACK button top-left
- `LevelCard.jsx` (new): portrait card with card BG image, diamond badge with sprite-cropped demon icon, inline SVG dividers, level name/subtitle/desc, spawn rate pips
- `LevelCard.css` (new): 195px wide, 355/559 aspect ratio, diamond badge hanging 19px above, sprite crop windows, text overlay
- `screens.css`: level-select section replaced; cards container positioned at `top: 42%`
- Assets downloaded to `cards/`: new card backgrounds, `sprite-easy-medium.png`, `sprite-hard.png`, updated diamond SVGs
- Card content position tuned to `top: 52%` inside card

**What I kept:**
- Everything — background, BACK button, all three cards, final position values

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Position iterated: `bottom: 4%` → `top: 52%` → `top: 46%` → `top: 42%` (card container)
- Card content: `top: 44%` → `top: 52%` (text inside card)
- RoR 6 (previous full implementation attempt) was rejected before this — this attempt was approved

**Why:**
Cards needed to align visually with the background art.

**Checkpoint:** YES — checkpoint-05.md

---

### Entry 14 — 2026-04-28 — Level Select Card Implementation Rejected

**What I asked AI to do:**
Re-implement Level Select screen with background image, three Figma card designs, diamond badges, and BACK button in upper left corner.

**What AI produced:**
- `LevelCard.jsx` — new component with card BG images, inline SVG diamond badges and dividers, text overlay, spawn rate pips
- `LevelCard.css` — portrait card layout with hanging diamond badge
- Updated `LevelSelect.jsx` — background image + LevelCard components + repositioned BACK button
- Updated `screens.css` — rewrote level-select section

**What I kept:**
- `LevelCard.jsx` and `LevelCard.css` (kept for reference, not connected)

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Rejected full implementation before it ran
- Reverted `LevelSelect.jsx` and `screens.css` to prior state

**Why:**
Not stated — user interrupted before build.

**Checkpoint:** NO

### Entry 16 — 2026-04-28 — Camera Permission Screen

**What I asked AI to do:**
Build the Camera Permission screen with a new background image (`demon slayer 3 background 1.png`), floating content (no panel), ALLOW CAMERA button matching the PLAY button style, bullet points explaining why the camera is needed, a privacy bar at the bottom, and a caption over the image area.

**What AI produced:**
- `CameraPermission.jsx` — full rewrite: no panel, floating `.cp-content` over background, BACK button reusing level select styles, ALLOW CAMERA button with hexagonal clip-path + `#ff1070` pink glow on wrapper, 3 bullets with icons, privacy note, bottom octagonal bar
- `screens.css` — all `.cp-*` classes added
- Third bullet line-break fixed with `display: flex; flexDirection: column` span

**What I kept:**
- Everything after position tuning

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Panel approach rejected immediately — wanted floating text like level select
- Figma export attempted and abandoned mid-way ("we are not designing in figma we are doing the project")
- ALLOW CAMERA button glow clipped by clip-path — fixed with wrapper div pattern (same as PLAY button)
- Multiple position iterations for `.cp-content`, `.cp-bar`, `.cp-image-caption`
- "WHY DO WE NEED IT?" alignment — needed `text-align: left` override
- Third bullet line alignment — `<br />` caused indent; fixed with flex column span

**Why:**
Floating layout matches level select design language. Panel felt too heavy for this screen.

**Checkpoint:** YES — checkpoint-06.md

---

### Entry 17 — 2026-04-29 — Countdown Screen + CSS HUD Panel

**What I asked AI to do:**
1. Build Countdown screen with transparent PNG countdown assets (3/2/1/GO) over background art — no camera feed.
2. Replace the `demon slayer 4 score combo time 1.png` HUD asset with a CSS-built bar matching the reference design.

**What AI produced:**
- `Countdown.jsx` — 4 transparent PNG assets swapped per step index, `demon slayer 3 background.png` as background, `countIn` scale-in animation
- `HUDPanel.jsx` — pure CSS bar: SCORE left / ✦ pip / COMBO center / ✦ pip / TIME right
- `HUDPanel.css` — three-layer purple `drop-shadow` on wrapper, angled clip-path on bar, timer low/critical states

**What I kept:**
- Everything after alignment and glow tuning

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Camera feed for countdown rejected — user didn't want camera as background
- HUD asset image rejected — too large; CSS version requested instead
- Crescent SVG ornament removed on request
- Combo `—` dash changed to `0`
- HUD purple glow intensity tuned to match PLAY button

**Why:**
User preferred clean background art over camera feed for countdown. CSS HUD gives more control over size and glow than a PNG asset.

**Checkpoint:** YES — checkpoint-07.md

---

### Entry 21 — 2026-04-29 — Sound On/Off Toggle

**What I asked AI to do:**
Add a sound on/off icon to the top right of every screen so users can mute the game.

**What AI produced:**
- `useAudio.js` — added `_masterGain` node that all audio routes through; `setMuted(bool)` and `isMuted()` exported
- `SoundToggle.jsx` — button with speaker-on/off SVG icons, reads and sets mute state
- `SoundToggle.css` — fixed top-right position, dark box with purple border, hover glow
- `App.jsx` — renders `<SoundToggle />` outside all panels so it persists across screens

**What I kept:**
- Everything

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Nothing rejected

**Why:**
—

**Checkpoint:** YES — checkpoint-11.md

---

### Entry 19 — 2026-04-29 — Game Over Screen

**What I asked AI to do:**
Build the Game Over screen triggered when lives reach 0: use `demon slayer game over background.png`, show score in the HUD (score only, centered with diamond pips), add PLAY AGAIN and BACK TO MENU hexagonal buttons.

**What AI produced:**
- `GameOver.jsx` — background image, `.go-actions` with two hexagonal buttons, plays `playTimesUp` sound
- `BrowserPanel.jsx` — `gameOver: GameOver` added to screenMap
- `ControllerPanel.jsx` — fixed routing bug: `gameScreen: 'gameOver'` on lives = 0 (was `'timesUp'`)
- `HUDPanel.jsx` — score-only layout for `gameScreen === 'gameOver'`; `showHUD` updated
- `HUDPanel.css` — `.hud-bar--score-only` modifier: centered, gap between pip and score
- `screens.css` — all `.go-*` classes: background, actions wrapper, hexagonal button border/fill, red + purple glows

**What I kept:**
- Everything after button position adjustment

**What I changed/rejected:**
- Buttons initially at `bottom: 12%` — moved to `bottom: 6%` (too high on screen)

**Why:**
Buttons were too far from the bottom of the background art.

**Checkpoint:** YES — checkpoint-10.md

---

### Entry 20 — 2026-04-29 — Times Up Screen: Background + Matching Layout

**What I asked AI to do:**
Apply the same treatment to Times Up: use `demon slayer times up background.png`, score-only HUD at top, PLAY AGAIN and BACK TO MENU hexagonal buttons.

**What AI produced:**
- `TimesUp.jsx` — rebuilt to match Game Over: background image + `.go-actions` buttons, removed grade badge / final score text / old buttons
- `HUDPanel.jsx` — score-only mode extended to `gameScreen === 'timesUp'`
- `screens.css` — `.timesup-screen`, `.timesup-bg`, `.timesup-content` added
- PLAY AGAIN on both screens routes to `levelSelect` (user corrected from `countdown`)

**What I kept:**
- Everything

**What I changed/rejected:**
- PLAY AGAIN initially routed to `countdown` — corrected to `levelSelect`

**Why:**
Player should re-pick their level when playing again, not skip straight into countdown with the same level.

**Checkpoint:** YES — checkpoint-10.md

---

### Entry 18 — 2026-04-29 — Gameplay Screen: Virtual Background Segmentation

**What I asked AI to do:**
Add a virtual background effect to the gameplay screen — player visible from camera, but their background replaced with the game background art (like Zoom virtual backgrounds).

**What AI produced:**
- `useBodySegmentation.js` — new hook using `@mediapipe/selfie_segmentation`, module-level singleton for early loading, throttled to ~15fps (every 4th frame), 640×360 canvas
- `Gameplay.jsx` — canvas added, hidden video feeds both MediaPipe models
- Side-effect import in `Countdown.jsx` to trigger model download during countdown
- Normal (non-mirrored) orientation on user request; hand tracking x un-mirrored to match

**What I kept:**
- Everything after performance tuning

**What I changed/rejected:**
- First version: rAF loop competed with Hands model → finger trail stopped working → fixed with throttling
- First version: model loaded at game start → slow/missing → fixed with singleton + countdown preload
- Mirrored orientation rejected — user wanted normal (non-selfie) view
- Canvas resolution reduced from 1280×720 to 640×360 for performance

**Why:**
Running both Hands and SelfieSegmentation at 60fps at full resolution was too heavy. Singleton preload hides CDN download behind countdown timer.

**Checkpoint:** YES — checkpoint-08.md
